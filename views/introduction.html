        The Genetic Fishbowl uses what is called a
        <i><a class="inline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithm</a></i>,
        so-called because it emulates certain biological processes. Each of the
        fish in the fishbowl has a single
        "<a class="inline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome">chromosome</a>."
        In biology, a chromosome is a series of chemically bonded nitrogen bases,
        but in this case, a fish’s chromosome is simply a series of values that
        affect a fish's appearance and behavior. Some fish survive while others do
        not, and the fish that are better-suited to the environment pass on their
        “genes” to the next generation, so the population slowly evolves to adapt
        to the environment. In our simulation, the system is interactive, so the
        user may kill or help fish if desired, making this a simulation of not
        only natural selection, but selective breeding as well. There are two
        modes of fish generation:
      </p>
      <h3>Iterative</h3>
      <p>
        This is the algorithm typically used in genetic algorithms. In this mode,
        a generation of fish is created and then competes against the other fish.
        Each of the fish is given a fitness score (based on the amount of food
        consumed), and at the end of the generation, fish with higher fitness
        scores are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation.
      </p>
      <h3>Continuous</h3>
      <p>
        A more unconventional approach to genetic algorithms (but more similar to
        biological evolution), this algorithm does not divide the simulation into
        generations. Instead, gameplay is continuous, and whenever a fish dies, a
        new fish is created. In this case, the fitness score is based on the
        amount of time a fish has been alive.
      </p>
      <p>The entire algorithm can be summarized as follows:</p>
      <h3>Initial population</h3>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the simulation, a population of fish is created, each
        with a random chromosome. The population size can be customized in the
        settings panel. At this stage (and also at the beginning of each
        generation, if the game is in iterative generation mode), the bowl is also
        populated with food for the fish. The amount of food is proportional to
        the population size.
      </p>
      <h3>User Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        The user can interact with the fish in two ways. The user can kill
        unwanted fish by left-clicking, and can place food in the bowl with a
        right-click. Note that if you are in iterative generation mode, the next
        generation will begin when either half of the fish die or all of the food
        runs out. The user can thus kill fish to shorten a generation, or add food
        to prolong it. If in continuous generation mode, the user can cause new
        fish to spawn by killing unwanted fish.
      </p>
      <h3>Fitness Score</h3>
      <p>
        Each fish is given a
        "<a class="inline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function">fitness score</a>"
        to be used in the selection process. If you are in iterative generation
        mode, the fitness score is based on how many energy points a fish has.
        Energy points are gained when the fish eat food, and are lost when fish
        move. If you are in continuous generation mode, a fish's fitness score is
        based on how long it has been alive.
      </p>
      <h3>Selection</h3>
      <p>
        A fish is selected for the next generation based on its fitness score.
        There are three methods of selection; they are discussed in depth on the
        <a class="inline" href="./selection.html">Selection</a> page. In iterative
        selection mode, a population of fish are selected for each generation. In
        continuous selection mode, whenever a fish dies, two fish are selected to
        be parents of a new fish.
      </p>
      <h3>Crossover</h3>
      <p>
        After fish are selected and paired, their chromosomes are combined to
        create a new fish. There are three methods of crossover discussed in depth
        on the <a class="inline" href="./crossover.html">Crossover</a> page. Note
        that there is not always a crossover, and the probability of there being a
        crossover is the "Crossover Rate" setting.
      </p>
      <h3>Mutation</h3>
      <p>
        In biological reproduction, mutation of genes often occurs during the
        crossover phase, but the two processes are separated here for the sake of
        simplicity. While mutation of DNA base pairs involves very low-level
        manipulation, our algorithm directly modifies the numerical chromosome
        values. For each new fish, each of the chromosome values is very slightly
        altered before the new fish is created. Read more on the
        <a class="inline" href="./mutation.html">Mutation</a> page.
